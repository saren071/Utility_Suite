"""
Unit tests for <module/feature>.

Purpose:
- Test the public API of the feature's run() function.
- Use pytest tmp_path fixtures to create temporary files/directories.
- Mock external system calls (psutil, GPUtil, winreg, subprocess) to avoid making real system changes.
- Ensure tests do not require admin and are safe to run on CI.
